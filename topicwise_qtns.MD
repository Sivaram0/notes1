BASICS ::
What is database ?
`A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is designed to store, retrieve, and manage information efficiently. Databases are used in almost every domain to store various types of data, such as customer details, financial transactions, inventory, and more. KEY_FEATURES ARE LIKE data initigrity, accessbility, availbility, security, concurency`

What is instance ?
`A database instance is the set of memory structures and background processes that interact with the database files to enable operations such as data storage, retrieval, and management. It serves as the interface between the physical database and the users or applications interacting with it.`
`Memory arch:: SGA[database buffer cache,shared pool,redolog buffer cache,large pool,], Program global area`
`Back ground process:: DBWr,LGWR,SMON,PMON,ARCHiver `
What is SGA ?
`The System Global Area (SGA) is a shared memory structure in Oracle databases that contains data and control information for a database instance. It is allocated when the database instance starts and is released when the instance shuts down. The SGA is critical for the operation of the Oracle instance, as it allows multiple users to access and interact with the database efficiently.`
What is oracle database server ?
`An Oracle Database Server is a software system designed to manage, store, and retrieve data efficiently. It provides a robust platform for running databases, enabling users and applications to interact with the data through SQL queries, transaction processing, and advanced features like backup, recovery, and security.`
