what is the difference between obsolete,expired,validate?
`Expaired: A backup or image copy is expired when RMAN cannot find it at its expected location (it may have been manually deleted or lost).`
`CROSSCHECK BACKUP;LIST EXPIRED BACKUP;DELETE EXPIRED BACKUP;`

Which is one is good, differential (incremental) backup or cumulative (incremental) backup?
Can we perform level 1 backup without level 0 backup?
What is the difference between a backup set and a backup piece?
Suppose you lost one datafile and DB is running in ARCHIVELOG mode. You have full database backup of 1 week/day old and donâ€™t have a backup of the (newly created) datafile. How do you restore/recover file?

What is the use of nofilenamecheck in RMAN ?
Do we need to shutdown the database to change the block change tracking file?
How will you identify a Physical Corruption/Logical corruption? What happens if you lose SPFILE and PFILE and DB crashed with some error, how will you start the database?
What are the database file's that RMAN cannot backup ?
Can we have archive logs and datafile backup in a single backupset ?
