 Steps to Delete a Data File
Identify the Data File: Determine which data file you want to delete. Make sure it is not being used by any active segments.

Move Segments (Optional): If the data file contains any data segments (tables, indexes, etc.), you may need to move them to another data file within the same tablespace using ALTER TABLE MOVE or ALTER INDEX REBUILD.

Offline the Data File: Make the data file offline to ensure no further operations can be performed on it.

//ALTER DATABASE DATAFILE '/u01/bsprod/oradata/bsprod/jim.dbf' OFFLINE;
Drop the Data File: Use the ALTER TABLESPACE command to drop the data file from the tablespace.
//ALTER TABLESPACE your_tablespace_name DROP DATAFILE '/u01/bsprod/oradata/bsprod/jim.dbf';

Remove the Physical File: Delete the physical data file from the file system at the OS level.
//rm /u01/bsprod/oradata/bsprod/jim.dbf
